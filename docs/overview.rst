An extension to the `Python Markdown`_ project which adds the ability to
subscript text. To do so, the character :code:`~` becomes a Markdown tag
for text meant to be subscripted, and is replaced with the HTML
:code:`sub` tag.

For example, given the text: ::

    The molecular composition of water is H~2~O.

â€¦ using Markdown with this extension will output:

.. code :: html

    <p>The molecular composition of water is H<sub>2</sub>O.</p>
